<h1>Stage 2: The Forest Trail</h1>
<p>
Following Chloe’s clues, you arrive at the edge of a forest just outside of town. The trees cast long shadows, and the air is thick with silence. You spot a faint trail leading deeper into the woods.
</p>
<p>
  You decide to...
</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>FOLLOW THE TRAIL (It seems as if someone has walked down this path recently)</li>
  <li>SEARCH THE AREA AROUND YOU (Maybe Chloe dropped something nearby)</li>
  <li>STOP (Not every case can be solved)</li>
</ul>  

  <p>
  Type your option below(FOLLOW THE TRAIL, SEARCH THE AREA AROUND YOU, STOP):
</p>
  
<input type="text" id="input" />
  <button onclick="submit()">submit</button>
</div>
  
<script>
function submit(){
  var option = document.getElementById("input").value;
  sessionStorage.setItem('option',option);
if (option == "FOLLOW THE TRAIL"){
  window.location.href = 'stage2option1.html';
}
else if (option == "SEARCH THE AREA AROUND YOU"){
  window.location.href = 'stage2option2.html';
}
  else if (option == "STOP"){
  window.location.href = 'stage2option3.html';
}
  else {
  }
}
</script>
