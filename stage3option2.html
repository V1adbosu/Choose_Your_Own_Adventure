<h1>Look for another way in (Going through the front door seems too easy, right?)</h1>

  <p>
You decide to look around the cabin before entering and find a cellar door. Assuming that the front door is a trap, you enter the cabin through the cellar door. As you enter the cabin you find recent footprints in the dust and walk into a room with a huge bulletin board. There are countless pictures of Chloe and red strings all over the place. In the middle of the bulletin board there is a letter pinned reading:
“ Dear Chloe, If you wish to know who I am, meet me at the village on friday night.” 
It seems like Chloe had a stalker, and they are meeting up tonight in the village. You must hurry and save her!
