<h1>Stage 6: Final Confrontation</h1>
<p>
As you step further into the barn, you think about hiding from a distance to see what the stalker is planning on doing. But suddenly, your foot catches on a loose board, and you stumble to the ground, the noise echoing through the barn. The stalker’s head snaps up, and their eyes lock onto yours with a cold, menacing glare. The air is tense, and you can feel the danger in every heartbeat. You’ll have to act fast if you want to get Chloe out of here safely.
</p>
<p>
  What tactic will you use to put an end to the case?:
</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>CREATE A SUDDEN DISTRACTION (Throw something at the stalker)</li>
  <li>CONFRONT THE STALKER (Fight the stalker)</li>
  <li>STOP (You are no match for the stalker)</li>
</ul>  

  <p>
  Type your option below(CREATE A SUDDEN DISTRACTION, CONFRONT THE STALKER, STOP):
</p>
  
<input type="text" id="input" />
  <button onclick="submit()">submit</button>
</div>
  
<script>
function submit(){
  var option = document.getElementById("input").value;
  sessionStorage.setItem('option',option);
if (option == "CREATE A SUDDEN DISTRACTION"){
  window.location.href = 'stage6option1.html';
}
else if (option == "CONFRONT THE STALKER"){
  window.location.href = 'stage6option2.html';
}
  else if (option == "STOP"){
